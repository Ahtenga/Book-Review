    "text": "My knuckles were bruised like violets\r\nSucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep talked\r\nSpineless in my tomb of silence\r\nTore your banners down, took the battle underground\r\nAnd maybe it was egos swinging\r\nMaybe it was her\r\nFlashes of the battle come back to me in a blur\r\n\r\nAll that bloodshed, crimson clover\r\nUh-huh, sweet dream was over\r\nMy hand was the one you reached for\r\nAll throughout the Great War\r\nAlways remember, uh-huh\r\nTears on the letter\r\nI vowed not to cry anymore\r\nIf we survived the Great War\r\n\r\nYou drew up some good faith treaties\r\nI drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone\r\nYou said I have to trust more freely\r\nBut diesel is desire, you were playing with fire\r\nAnd maybe it's the past that's talking\r\nScreaming from the crypt\r\nTelling me to punish you for things you never did\r\nSo I justified it\r\n\r\nAll that bloodshed, crimson clover\r\nUh-huh, the bombs were closer\r\nMy hand was the one you reached for\r\nAll throughout the Great War\r\nAlways remember, uh-huh\r\nThe burning embers\r\nI vowed not to fight anymore\r\nIf we survived the Great War\r\nUh-huh, uh-huh\r\n\r\nIt turned into something bigger\r\nSomewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed\r\nYour finger on my hairpin triggers\r\nSoldier down on that icy ground\r\nLooked up at me with honor and truth\r\nBroken and blue, so I called off the troops\r\nThat was the night I nearly lost you\r\nI really thought I'd lost you\r\n\r\nWe can plant a memory garden\r\nSay a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair\r\nThere's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair\r\nAnd we will never go back to that\r\n\r\nBloodshed, crimson clover\r\nUh-huh, the worst was over\r\nMy hand was the one you reached for\r\nAll throughout the Great War\r\nAlways remember, uh-huh\r\nWe're burned for better\r\nI vowed I would always be yours\r\n'Cause we survived the Great War\r\n\r\nUh-huh, uh-huh\r\nI will always be yours\r\n'Cause we survived the Great War\r\nUh-huh\r\nI vowed I will always be yours",

A tribute to Swift's maternal grandmother, the opera singer Marjorie Finlay, the song features bits of advice that Finlay offered to Swift and touches on her guilt over not knowing Finlay to the fullest. \"Marjorie\" is a sentimental ballad that incorporates electronic keyboard arrangement, pizzicato strings, and samples of Finlay's soprano vocals.",
